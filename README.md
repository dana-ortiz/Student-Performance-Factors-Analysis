To prepare the data for analysis, all categorical variables were cleaned and converted into numerical form. 
Ordinal variables such as "Parental Involvement" were mapped to numerical values from 1 to 3 based on levels of “Low,” “Medium,” and “High.” 
Binary variables like “Internet Access” were encoded as 1 for “Yes” and 0 for “No.”
